#New York City

Last visited in January 2014.


##Food/drink

####Barcade (http://www.barcadebrooklyn.com)
Close to the subway, this is a bar and an arcade in one. Cocktails are very strong, and there’s a great selection of beers. TS tag to find in the ladies toilets.
 
####Shanghai Joe’s (http://www.joeshanghairestaurants.com)
If you're in Chinatown, Shanghai Joe's does excellent dumplings, and huge portions.

####Momofuku Noodle Bar/Ssam/Milk Bar (crack pie)/Booker & Dax (http://momofuku.com)
All run by the same people, these places are usually very busy but a good bet. The Momofuku ramen at the Noodle Bar was good, but suffered from very poor service. Milk Bar stays open late - grab a slice of Crack Pie after your noodles.

####Junior’s Cheesecake (Brooklyn/Times Square/Grand Central)
Cheesecake and cake. Either eat in the restaurant or get a takeaway from the coffee shop next door.

####The Spotted Pig (http://thespottedpig.com)
To date, their burger is my favourite that I have ever eaten. Served with rosemary and garlic shoestring fries. They also do excellent bloody marys - a rarity. Book, or be prepared to wait a long time.
 
####Burger Joint at Le Parker Meridien (http://www.burgerjointny.com)
Go into the lobby, turn left down a small corridor before the end. You’ll see a neon burger sign. It's a packed, tiny room, that does pretty good (filthy) burgers. Write on the walls. TS tag to find in one of the booths.

####Pershing Square Cafe (http://www.pershingsquare.com)
Excellent blueberry pancakes. Jasmine tea!

####Johny’s Luncheonette (http://www.johnysluncheonette.com)
Cheap, hearty breakfasts. Tiny little place and nothing amazingly special, but great if you’re in the area and just want some classic diner food.

####Brooklyn Diner (http://www.brooklyndiner.com)
The polenta and pomodoro sauce you get with the 3 eggs (poached please) and bacon were great.

####Hill Country Barbecue and Market (http://www.hillcountryny.com)
Get your meat by the weight, plus a table full of sides. You'll probably die. You may have to wait in the bar with a buzzer to get a table, and I was so jetlagged that I can't remember what was good, so try it all.

##Untried recommendations from others

Izakaya MEW (http://mewnyc.com/mew/)


####Eileen’s Special Cheesecake

####Soba Koh

####Bleeker Pizza

- There's a diner called Big Daddy's round the corner from that hotel that does epic burgers and tater tots :) It's also not far from Shake Shack in Gramercy Park - good for a midnight snack (no really, the only time there isn't a queue is after 9pm...) 
- Brooklyn Flea was cool, v. hipster, but quite good for souvenirs. Brooklyn in general was great - there's a Mayonnaise shop on the way that literally just sells mayo :) But there was a shooting on a road we'd walked down about 3 hours earlier, so leave before dark! 

korzo haus burgers are the ultimate.
Roberta's in Brooklyn for pizza.

Get down to Williamsburg for drinks and I actually recommend Time Out for events while you are there

East 10th Street Russian and Turkish baths

SalvationTaco then rooftop bar after for drinks. Clinton St Bakery best pancakes. Serendipity_3 frozen hot chocolate

two boots in amazing! theres a lush champagne bar at grand central. go when it goes dark. the ceiling is amazing.

WD~50 if you really want to get into some interesting molecular gastronomy (ttp://wd-50.com)

Cycle around Central Park and hire your bikes from Hells Kitchen (60th street area).
Go to Valhallar in Hells Kitchen (815 9th Ave) for random beers but great pub atmosphere.
Williamsburg - go there.
Do the Brooklyn Brewery Tour. Right opposite the brewery is a great vintage ship selling vintage t shirts and amazing stuff in general - called Beacons closet I think.
Go to the Lucky Dog pub in Williamsburg and play shuffleboard - you can graffiti the ladies loo door next to Beyonces signature.
