##Food/drink

####Valhalla (http://valhallabarnyc.com)
Great place to spend a couple of hours on a lazy afternoon. Large draft and bottled beer selection (I can recommend the Otter Creek Over Grown Pale Ale, and not just because otters). They also do a lunch special with any draft beer and any dish for $13. Nachos with beef are really good. Great music, friendly barman, good atmosphere.

####Izakaya MEW (http://mewnyc.com/mew/)
Small, noisy basement izakaya with a very Japanese feel. You'll probably have to wait as it's extremely popular, but there are some great beers to try whilst you do. The menu is huge, and ranges from sushi and sashimi through to Ramen, more Korean-led dishes, salads, kushiyaki, and loads more. I can recommend the buta kimchi and tonkotsu ramen, but there was so much I would have liked to have tried. The 'squid legs' were (I hope intentionally) very over-cooked by normal standards, but very flavourful. Try the Frozen Kirin if you want an ice-cold beer with frozen foam on the top.

####Black Iron Burger (http://www.blackironburgermidtown.com/)
Tried as a lazy, jetlagged meal as it was close to the hotel, these are actually pretty good burgers. Try the Wasabi burger rare (without the mushroom) - not quite as wasabi as I'd like, but extremely juicy and served with nori. The garlic or aioli fries were also good, but bear in mind that portions of fries are huge - one between two normal people is fine.

####Barcade (http://www.barcadebrooklyn.com)
Close to the subway, this is a bar and an arcade in one. Cocktails are very strong, and there’s a great selection of beers. TS tag to find in the ladies toilets.
 
####Shanghai Joe’s (http://www.joeshanghairestaurants.com)
If you're in Chinatown, Shanghai Joe's does excellent dumplings, and huge portions.

####Momofuku Noodle Bar/Ssam/Milk Bar (crack pie)/Booker & Dax (http://momofuku.com)
All run by the same people, these places are usually very busy but a good bet. The Momofuku ramen at the Noodle Bar was good, but suffered from very poor service. Milk Bar stays open late - grab a slice of Crack Pie after your noodles.

####Junior’s Cheesecake (Brooklyn/Times Square/Grand Central)
Cheesecake and cake. Either eat in the restaurant or get a takeaway from the coffee shop next door.

####The Spotted Pig (http://thespottedpig.com)
To date, their burger is my favourite that I have ever eaten. Served with rosemary and garlic shoestring fries. They also do excellent bloody marys - a rarity. Book, or be prepared to wait a long time.
 
####Burger Joint at Le Parker Meridien (http://www.burgerjointny.com)
Go into the lobby, turn left down a small corridor before the end. You’ll see a neon burger sign. It's a packed, tiny room, that does pretty good (filthy) burgers. Write on the walls. TS tag to find in one of the booths.

####Pershing Square Cafe (http://www.pershingsquare.com)
Excellent blueberry pancakes. Jasmine tea!

####Johny’s Luncheonette (http://www.johnysluncheonette.com)
Cheap, hearty breakfasts. Tiny little place and nothing amazingly special, but great if you’re in the area and just want some classic diner food.

####Brooklyn Diner (http://www.brooklyndiner.com)
The polenta and pomodoro sauce you get with the 3 eggs (poached please) and bacon were great.

####Hill Country Barbecue and Market (http://www.hillcountryny.com)
Get your meat by the weight, plus a table full of sides. You'll probably die from fatness. You may have to wait in the bar with a buzzer to get a table, and I was so jetlagged that I can't remember what was good, so try it all.

##Places

####Metropolitan Museum of Art (http://www.metmuseum.org/)

####Brooklyn Smorgasburg & Winter Flea (http://brooklynflea.com/markets/winter-flea-smorgasburg-industry-city/)
Held at Industry City in the winter (location changes in the summer), this is a very hipster but hugely interesting takeover of a warehouse. Shops range from amazing furniture that made me wish I could ship it back, to Post-it art, to all sorts of vintage oddities. Food-wise, I understand that there's much more in the summer version, but I HIGHLY recommend the Adobo Shack. The Sisig, and pork rib adobo were brilliant.

##Untried recommendations from others

####Please Don't Tell
Oli C - "Epic hidden cocktail bar - entrance is inside a phone booth in Crif Dog’s next door. You’re best calling bang on 3pm the same day (+1 (212) 614 0386) to reserve a table - they go QUICK. We had to try and get through for AGES to get a booking for Fri night, so I’d pick another night if poss."

####Modern Pinball NYC (http://www.modernpinballnyc.com/)

####Eileen’s Special Cheesecake

####Soba Koh

####Bleeker Pizza

- There's a diner called Big Daddy's round the corner from that hotel that does epic burgers and tater tots :) It's also not far from Shake Shack in Gramercy Park - good for a midnight snack (no really, the only time there isn't a queue is after 9pm...) 

korzo haus burgers are the ultimate.
Roberta's in Brooklyn for pizza.

Get down to Williamsburg for drinks and I actually recommend Time Out for events while you are there

East 10th Street Russian and Turkish baths

SalvationTaco then rooftop bar after for drinks. Clinton St Bakery best pancakes. Serendipity_3 frozen hot chocolate

two boots in amazing! theres a lush champagne bar at grand central. go when it goes dark. the ceiling is amazing.

WD~50 if you really want to get into some interesting molecular gastronomy (ttp://wd-50.com)

Williamsburg - go there.
Do the Brooklyn Brewery Tour. Right opposite the brewery is a great vintage ship selling vintage t shirts and amazing stuff in general - called Beacons closet I think.
Go to the Lucky Dog pub in Williamsburg and play shuffleboard - you can graffiti the ladies loo door next to Beyonces signature.
