##Food & drink

####Augustiner am Gendarmenmarkt (http://www.augustiner-braeu-berlin.de/)


###Recommendations

One of the best bars we found there is Hops & Barley Hausbrauerei
Another good one, Hopfenreich- Craft Beer Bar 
In the West, Brauhaus Lemke great food and beer

sushi: Omoni in Kopenhagener Str. - bandolsurmer.de for something  *exceptional* ;-)

If you want something quirky (but kinda cool) the Museum of Things is worth seeking out.

Really liked the Cathedral/Dom, worth the climb. French Dom for views too & Deutcher Dom (free museum). Ampelmann pizza is good!
