##Food & drink

####Augustiner am Gendarmenmarkt (http://www.augustiner-braeu-berlin.de/)


###Recommendations

####Food and drink
One of the best bars we found there is Hops & Barley Hausbrauerei
Another good one, Hopfenreich- Craft Beer Bar 
In the West, Brauhaus Lemke great food and beer

sushi: Omoni in Kopenhagener Str. - bandolsurmer.de for something  *exceptional* ;-)

Ampelmann pizza is good!

White Trash on Schonhauser Allee for amazing burgers - or for great burgers/steak and fewer English tourists, The Bird further into P'Berg on Falkplatz is amazing.

Buy beer in plastic bottles from Lidl and then take back the empties to put in the machine and get 25 cents back.

In this weather Cafe am Neue See in Tiergarten is a must

Veer away from breakfast buffets on Sunday and instead stick for places who do it to order - it's normally better food and is more than enough.

There's a great Thai place on Bergmannstrasse in Kreuzberg.

If you're short on cash there's a vegan 'Volkskuchen' place in Friedrichshain which on Sunday nights does a massive plate of food and a beer for about 3 euros.

Konnipke's Imbiss under Eberswalder Strasse station is great for currywurst.

Oh and Sankt Oberholz at Rosenthaler Platz is an amazing cafe place if you need to use wifi - it's kinda the freelancers centre of Berlin - and the kebab shop across the road (underneath the gym) is one of the best in the city.

####Things to do and see

Computerspielemuseum

Natural history museum

Oberbaum bridge
+ East Side Gallery

Nikolaikirche, Nicholas Quarter (south of hotel)

If you want something quirky (but kinda cool) the Museum of Things is worth seeking out.

Really liked the Cathedral/Dom, worth the climb.
French Dom for views too & Deutcher Dom (free museum). 

The zoo is incredible, if you're into zoos (who isn't?).

Watergate and Weekend are also both good clubs.

Teufelsberg

####Tips

Buy a week's U-Bahn pass rather than one of the tourist passes - you only need zones A-B but get a single A-C if you're going into town from Schonefeld, they check quite regularly.

Flea market in Mauer Park in Prenzlauer Berg on Sunday will be INSANELY busy and hot and isn't always that enjoyable because of those things - I prefer the Boxhagener Platz one in Freidrichshain.
