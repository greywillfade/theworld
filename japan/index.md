# Japan

If you're here, it's probably because you know how much I love Japan and I've either forced my recommendations on you, or you've possibly asked for some. Japan is my favourite place in the whole world - if I could choose to live anywhere it'd be there - and as we've ben visiting since 2008 I have quite a lot of things that I like doing there!

This guide is still horribly incomplete (as with everything in this repository...), so if there's anything else that you'd like to ask about please get in touch. I always welcome the chance to chat about this wonderful place.

The disclaimer here (even more than other countries) is that the cities in particular can be vast and ever-changing, so these recommendations may date very quickly! Also, as great as some spots are, you'll find your own just by wandering. There's so much to see and do and some of the things that you just stumble across can be the most special.

The following sections have some general advice for Japan, but dive straight into individual areas for more specific recommendations.

## Language
Let's start with a bit about the basics - how to communicate.

Most urban areas have noticeably gained much more support for English speakers over the years, and there have been little things added (like the addition of numbered codes for train station stops in Tokyo) that are all designed to make getting around just that bit easier. However, it's important to note that the more remote you're going, you absolutely shouldn't expect the same level of English to be spoken (or to appear on menus etc). Also, even in some parts of big cities everything can still be a bit overwhelming on your first trip, especially if this is your first time to a place where the written characters are so utterly different to English.

Don't go into it blind and expect everyone to understand you, but also don't be scared - you'll be absolutely fine. Also, the usual applies - a little bit of language goes a long way and even with a handful of basic phrases you'll have locals praising how 上手 (skilled) your Japanese is! If you have the time and care enough, I'd also really recommend trying to learn some hiragana and katakana before you go. I've written a ton about the resources that I recommend for learning over on [my blog](https://sallylait.com/blog/2018/08/24/learning-japanese/) if you want to go into this more.

## Take cash
This may sound stupid, but with many people carrying less cash at home, I've also encountered people who go abroad with nothing but a credit card. If you're going to Japan, I _don't_ advise this. Sure, for many things - shopping, hotels, train tickets, some restaurants, you'll be able to get around absolutely fine on cards. But if you have absolutely none you'll start to notice that you're a bit restricted in some places - smaller shops and restaurants often only take cash, and of course you'll want to hoarde your 100 yen coins for gacha machines!

## Get a local SIM
If you're coming from the UK, roaming in Japan tends to be _expensive_. However, you're absolutely going to want data (and not just for all of those Instagram shots) - it's going to be a huge help for maps, getting around on public transport, and translation. The first time I went to Japan I used a printed street atlas and failed to find tons of things - Google Maps will make your life so much easier!

Many apartments and hotels have started to offer pocket wifi, however for convenience I always buy a local "tourist SIM" as I've got an unlocked phone. You can check online with companies like [b-mobile](http://www.bmobile.ne.jp/english/) to buy a local SIM card and get it delivered to the airport post office (there's one at Narita and one at Haneda Domestic, but check opening hours against your flight landing time), or your hotel. It's extremely simple to collect things at the airport, but alternatively you can pick them up from airport shops, or from electronics stores like Bic Camera in the city.

The offerings change so rapidly that it's not worth me namechecking too many, but b-mobile have served me well over the last couple of trips with a 5GB/21 day plan, and before that they had an unlimited (but slow after high usage) 14 day option.

## Getting around on trains
The trains in Japan are *fantastic*. They're also run by different networks, have some differences as you travel around, and can be a bit confusing at first.

If you're thinking about taking any longer distance trains you may be better off investigating the [Japan Rail Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Rail_Pass) (a rail pass for overseas visitors). This lets you inclusively travel on selected bullet trains (some types are not included), on the underground network, and other things run by Japan Rail for the duration of your pass. Buy a voucher for the pass in advance, sent to you at home, which you then redeem at JR stations once you get to Japan. You also must get a Temporary Visitor stamp in your passport on arrival.

It's also worth reading up on the different companies for where you're going, as this will remove some of your confusion. For instance in Tokyo you'll want a Tokyo Metro subway map as well as a JR one! Stations from different networks don't connect, so at a station that has both systems you may need to resurface and go back down into the other network.

For planning journeys, your best bet is the [Hyperdia](http://www.hyperdia.com/en/) site or app. I've had a few instances where Google didn't know about some of the options on Hyperdia, and it's well worth referring to if you're not sure of how to get somewhere. You can also have a specific journey open to show at a reservation counter if you want to book on a specific train.

For subway systems in places like Tokyo and Osaka there are english buttons on the train screens if you need, but the principle is you pay the price shown on the map (top for adult, bottom is child) for a single trip to your destination, or you can also buy different types of day pass, or pay with a pre-paid card (see next section).

## IC cards
Big in Japan are prepaid currency cards that you can use to jump on trains, to pay at vending machines, and even in some shops. In Tokyo you'll see [PASMO](https://www.pasmo.co.jp/en/) and [Suica](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/suica.html), which are essentially the same thing and are very very useful. Again, depending on where you're going bear in mind that these may not be accepted in certain shops, train networks, or geographic areas.
