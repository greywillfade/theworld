# Atami
Stayed in Atami September 2017

## Places to stay

### Watei Kazekomichi [WA亭 風こみち](http://www.kazekomichi.jp/en/)
Located on the cliffs, this is a tiny, stunning little hotel with incredible service. We stayed in the top floor Kiritsubo room, which is the largest in the ryokan and features a beautiful double-aspect living room. We stayed here because of the natural private onsen on the balcony, which was lovely paired with the summer sea breeze. Our room gave us the option of kaiseki dinner either in the dining room or in our living room, and we tried both. The dining room is actually a series of private booths, all served from the front, looking out down the cliffs. The hotel provides a free drop-off service to Atami station - make sure that you make use of this as the hills are ridiculously steep and there aren't pavements!

## Things to do

### Atami ropeway
The way up to the castle, the ropeway seems to only run periodically based on whether there are enough people. Go up here to get a great view of the bay whilst enjoying a beer.

### Atami castle
There's no other way to describe it; this is **odd**. You can see Atami's castle on the cliff from everywhere in the bay. Made in the traditional style, it's not until you get up close until you realise... it's concrete. The entire castle was purpose built as a tourist attraction in the 1950s, and there was never a historical one. Despite that, it manages to be pretty fascinating. You of course have even better views, but there's also everything from floors of museum items, to matchstick buildings, costumes you can wear... a hentai exhibit... and in the basement a totally free-to-play arcade. Yep, an arcade. Many of the games are a bit dated, but to be honest we got more than our entry price out of that alone!

### Adult museum
This page wouldn't feel complete without a nod to this. At the top of the ropeway is Atami's adult museum, where you must pass through the lobby to exit. Sadly we ran out of time, and couldn't complete our original plan of having several drinks and looking around. As they put it, "You must be at least as tall as the whale penis replica to enjoy this collection" (or be over 18 and have ID). From memory it's pricey, but there are apparently holograms, interactive displays, and a penis ride.
