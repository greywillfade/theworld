#Hotels
- Sakura Terrace The Gallery http://sakuraterrace-gallery.jp/en/
This hotel was a little gem. Close to Kyoto station (but not so close at to worry about noise), this is an incredibly reasonable place to stay which has some great perks. Free drink every night, laundry and detergent, onsens, wifi, and coffee lounges with jasmine tea. Rooms are small and do have a lack of storage, but are nicely enough designed and most (if not all?) come with a balcony. The main atrium is open air which is lovely in summer.

#Restaurants
- Toraji (Yodobashi 6th floor) http://www.ebisu-toraji.com/en/shop/kyotofu/kyoto/kyoto/?area=kyoto
- Food market at Fushimi-Inari

###Katsukura かつくら四条東洞院店
Amazing tonkatsu. There is an air of ceremony about this place without it being overwhelming. Drink oolong, grind your sesame before mixing in sauces of your choice, and ladle yuzu over your cabbage before tucking into the juciest cutlets.

###花たぬき 京都駅前店 (Hanatanuki Okonomiyaki) http://hanatanuki.jp/?id=37
Very friendly staff. English menu available. The Special-Tanuki yaki is good, but the pork Kyoto style with extra garlic, soy and mayo is ace.

###寿しのむさし 京都駅八条口店 (Sushi Musashi Jr Kyotoasuteirodoten)
Reasonably cheap sushi option in the station. They have some more varied options than many, including 'horse mane' if you're so inclined.


#Things to do
- Nara (deer and Todai-ji)
- Fushimi-Inari
- Nijo-jo castle
- Kiyomizu-dera Temple (currently being renovated and you can't get to the key bits)

#Eki stamps

All of the stamps in Kyoto seem to be round and much larger than those in Tokyo, so be careful when buying something to keep them in!

###Kyoto
This one is inside ticket gates. As you go through the main Central Gates from the new atrium, there is a ticket office on the right, opposite the escalator up to the JR Nara line. The stamp is stood by the ticket windows. This is an automated stamp press.

###JR Nijo
This one is inside the ticket gates as you come in. Automated stamp press, has a tendency to over-ink.

###JR Nara
This one needs asking for. Go to the manned ticket gate (there's only one entrance) and ask for it, and they will hand it over.

###JR Inari
Another one where you need to ask at the manned ticket gate for them to hand it over. Again, only one entrance.
