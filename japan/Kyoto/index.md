#Eki stamps

All of the stamps in Kyoto seem to be round and much larger than those in Tokyo, so be careful when buying something to keep them in!

###Kyoto
This one is inside ticket gates. As you go through the main Central Gates from the new atrium, there is a ticket office on the right, opposite the escalator up to the JR Nara line. The stamp is stood by the ticket windows. This is an automated stamp press.

###JR Nijo
This one is inside the ticket gates as you come in. Automated stamp press, has a tendency to over-ink.

###JR Nara
This one needs asking for. Go to the manned ticket gate (there's only one entrance) and ask for it, and they will hand it over.

###JR Inari
Another one where you need to ask at the manned ticket gate for them to hand it over. Again, only one entrance.
