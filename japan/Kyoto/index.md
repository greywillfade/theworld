# Kyoto
Last visited September 2017.

## Places to stay

## [Sakura Terrace The Gallery](http://sakuraterrace-gallery.jp/en/)
This hotel is a little gem. Close to Kyoto station (but not so close at to worry about noise), this is an incredibly reasonable place to stay which has some great perks. Free drink every night, laundry and detergent, onsens, wifi, and coffee lounges with jasmine tea. Rooms are small and do have a lack of storage, but are nicely enough designed and most (if not all?) come with a balcony. The main atrium is open air which is lovely in summer.

## Places to eat and drink

### うなぎ料理 美登利
We found this unagi restaurant after looking for recommendations, and on turning up were the only people there. Despite that we received a very warm welcome. It's found up some steps, so keep an eye open when you get to the vicinity as we originally went past. I had the ひつまむし (hitsumamushi) set that involved mixing in your own condiments or turning it into ochazuke, and it was excellent.

### [Arashiyama Yoshimura](http://www.arashiyama-yoshimura.com/soba/)
Another one that we picked based on reviews. As this is in a hugely touristy area, be prepared for a wait. We went in the height of summer and didn't have to wait very long for a couple of people. This soba/tempura restaurant is another one where sets are a good choice, which you eat in beautiful and very formal environment (shoes off).

### Katsukura かつくら四条東洞院店
Amazing tonkatsu, found in several locations around the city (now including Kyoto station). There is an air of ceremony about this place without it being overwhelming. Drink oolong, grind your sesame before mixing in sauces of your choice, and ladle yuzu over your cabbage before tucking into the juciest cutlets.

### やきとり一番 八条口店
We found this little yakitori place after looking for places close to Sakura Terrace, as we were running in between typhoon downpours. This place turned out to be a wonderful spot to spend the evening munching on all sorts and drinking our way through several bottles of sake whilst chatting to friendly locals (a Japanese vet ended up showing us loads of photos of him and cows!). Whilst there was a menu with some English bear in mind this is a very Japanese place, and could be quite intimidating to the uninitiated! Excellent food - loved the heads of garlic and chicken skin amongst others.

### Food Hub and Labo
Classy little modern spot that looked inviting after we went on a pilgrimage to the Nintendo HQ. Nice selection of drinks and snacks if you're over this way, and chatty barmen who are very tolerant of poor Japanese!

### 花たぬき 京都駅前店 (Hanatanuki Okonomiyaki) http://hanatanuki.jp/?id=37
This popular okonomiyaki restaurant is a very enjoyable visit with memorably friendly staff. There is an English menu available if needed. The Special-Tanuki yaki is good, but the pork Kyoto style with extra garlic, soy and mayo is ace.

### 寿しのむさし 京都駅八条口店 (Sushi Musashi Jr Kyotoasuteirodoten)
Reasonably cheap sushi option in the station. They have some more varied options than many, including 'horse mane' if you're so inclined.

# Eki stamps

All of the stamps in Kyoto seem to be round and much larger than those in Tokyo, so be careful when buying something to keep them in!

### Kyoto
This one is inside ticket gates. As you go through the main Central Gates from the new atrium, there is a ticket office on the right, opposite the escalator up to the JR Nara line. The stamp is stood by the ticket windows. This is an automated stamp press.

### JR Nijo
This one is inside the ticket gates as you come in. Automated stamp press, has a tendency to over-ink.

### JR Nara
This one needs asking for. Go to the manned ticket gate (there's only one entrance) and ask for it, and they will hand it over.

### JR Inari
Another one where you need to ask at the manned ticket gate for them to hand it over. Again, only one entrance.
