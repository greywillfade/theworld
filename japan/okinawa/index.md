# Logistics

Arriving into Naha airport on an international flight was confuaing. It's the only airport I've ever been to where the international terminal is tiny compared to the domestic terminal. On international flights aim to be at the front of the plane. After immigration you'll collect your bag feom people passing it to you (no belts), clearing the customs folk, and then you'll have to queue to leave the building on a bus that will ferry you to the domestic terminal.
