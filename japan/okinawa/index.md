Staying on Okinawa Island in October 2017, we stayed in Naha city and the Nanjo area.

## Logistics

Arriving into Naha airport on an *international* flight was confusing. It's the only airport I've ever been to where the international terminal is tiny compared to the domestic terminal. As in, it's practically a shed. On international flights aim to be at the front of the plane. After immigration you'll collect your bag feom people passing it to you through a doorway (no belts), clearing the customs folk, and then you'll have to **queue to leave the building on a bus** that will ferry you to the domestic terminal. From here you can continue your journey. There's  tiny kiosk and a couple of car hire desks within the International terminal/shed but that's it.

Flying out of Naha on a Domestic flight was very different. There are extensive restaurants and shops, and there are little 7-11 type deals the whole way down to the gates who do takeaway ramen or chashumans (or of course onigiri) etc.

Little thing that may change, but you're allowed to take liquids through security (including bottles of opened drinks) on domestic flights (October 2017).

Pay attention to typhoon season. I was pretty blase about it, having grown up with tropical storms, but we actually got hit by Typhoon Talim once on Okinawa and once on the mainland. The typhoon itself was fine, but smaller islands were hit much harder and a ton of flights were cancelled - bear this in mind if your timings are inflexible.

## Hotels

### Hyatt Regency Naha
Nothing special at all, but a decent enough base for exploring Naha. The hotel is pretty close to the Monorail that spans the city (and can take you to the airport), or is about a 20 minute taxi in. You're really close to the main restaurant/shopping strip that cuts through (Kokusai dori), but in a quiet enough residential location so as not to be totally crowded.
