Staying on Okinawa Island in October 2017, we stayed in Naha city and the Nanjo area.

## Logistics

Arriving into Naha airport on an *international* flight was confusing. It's the only airport I've ever been to where the international terminal is tiny compared to the domestic terminal. As in, it's practically a shed. On international flights aim to be at the front of the plane. After immigration you'll collect your bag feom people passing it to you through a doorway (no belts), clearing the customs folk, and then you'll have to **queue to leave the building on a bus** that will ferry you to the domestic terminal. From here you can continue your journey. There's  tiny kiosk and a couple of car hire desks within the International terminal/shed but that's it.

Flying out of Naha on a Domestic flight was very different. There are extensive restaurants and shops, and there are little 7-11 type deals the whole way down to the gates who do takeaway ramen or chashumans (or of course onigiri) etc.

Little thing that may change, but you're allowed to take liquids through security (including bottles of opened drinks) on domestic flights (October 2017).

Pay attention to typhoon season. I was pretty blase about it, having grown up with tropical storms, but we actually got hit by Typhoon Talim once on Okinawa and once on the mainland. The typhoon itself was fine, but smaller islands were hit much harder and a ton of flights were cancelled - bear this in mind if your timings are inflexible.

## Hotels

### Hyatt Regency Naha
Nothing special at all (common areas are nice but rooms are a little bit dated), this is however a decent enough base for exploring Naha. The hotel is pretty close to the Monorail that spans the city (and can take you to the airport), or is about a 20 minute taxi in. You're really close to the main restaurant/shopping strip that cuts through (Kokusai dori), but in a quiet enough residential location so as not to be totally crowded.

### Hyakunagaran (百名伽藍)
[hyakunagaran.com](http://www.hyakunagaran.com/English/)
Such an amazing place. Our room was one of the executive suites, on the corner of the building, with a balcony right on the cliff face. It's located in an extremely quiet area, but you can easily walk to Mibaru Beach in one direction (diving, glass-bottomed boats, couple of restaurants), a longer walk in the other direction to Oujima, or there are other little restaurants nearby. Come here if you want a beautiful, remote, relaxing getaway with _amazing_ food comparable with Michelin-starred restaurants. Breakfast and dinner are both multi-course affairs, and I can't praise the food and staff highly enough. Make sure that you take advantage of the rooftop houjouan - private open-air hot baths, sun loungers, a tatami room, plus a toilet and shower. Sunset is particularly special. If you're after a bit of culture, there's also a little art gallery in the basement, and a small library with teas and coffees.

## Food and drink

### Nanjo-area

#### [Nakamoto tempura 中本鮮魚てんぷら店](http://nakamotosengyoten.com/)
Tiny, hole in the wall shop serving excellent fresh seafood tempura, with a couple of benches for perching on (or just take them over to the beach). Menu is all in Japanese, and ordering is done with a pre-printed piece of paper that you mark your order on and hand over at the counter.

#### [Kunnatou くんなとぅ](http://kunnatou.com/)
Soba restaurant on the seafront serving all kinds of local mozuku (Okinawan seaweed)/soba dishes and sets.

#### 食堂かりか
Nepalese curry spot on Mibaru beach. Really simple fare (bowls of curry and rice served with bitter melon, plus samosas etc), but tasty and from experience a lovely spot to perch all afternoon whilst drinking many local Orion beers.

#### [Yamanochaya 山の茶屋](http://yama.hamabenochaya.com/)
The only recommendation here that we didn't get to (due to it being shut for the typhoon), this is a vegetarian restaurant that reviews extremely well and looks to have some very tasty food. We walked up to it, and the location is really pretty - tucked right into the hill. Note that they also have a sister 'sandwich shop' very close by, which is right on the seafront.

### Naha-area

#### Yuunangii ゆうなんぎい
Looking at reviews to find somewhere special to go for our first night's meal, this place stood out (and rightly!). It's a small izakaya that's got a great atmosphere, and serves very Okinawan food. We had an excellent set meal to try as much as possible. Go early, and expect to wait outside until you make it into the small inside waiting area.

#### [Onigiri Honten](http://porktamago.com/)
Within Makishi market lives this onigiri place. I didn't get a chance to go, which was a big disappointment (next time!). Serving all kinds of 'onigiri' in the form of little sandwiches, this looked like an excellent snack spot.

#### International Street Food Village [国際通り屋台村](http://www.okinawa-yatai.jp/)
Just off the main street through Naha, this little collection of individual restaurants is well worth a stop as there's a great selection. We stopped at one place on the corner of an entrance (there are two ways in) which I stupidly didn't record the name of, but had some excellent gyoza in a tonkotsu-esque broth.

#### 鶏さん
Tiny little kushiyaki stand on the crossroads near the Hyatt Regency, this always smells *amazing* when walking past. We finally gave in and had a few skewers for a couple of hundred Yen, which was the correct decision. Great place for a quick snack.

#### Helios craft beer pub
Serving one of the local brews, this is a pretty westernised and quite sterile environment, but worth it to pop in and have some local beer (plus their really good fried complementary beer snacks!)

## Things to do

### Makishi market
A deceptively massive market with entrances all over, this is a good wander and way to browse all kinds of produce and souvenirs. There are also places to eat here.

### 首里城 Shuri-jō (Naha's castle)
Take the monorail over to the castle side of town, and walk up to it through the houses (shīsā spotting). The sad thing about this castle is evident almost instantly - all of the information boards pretty much end "...and then it was bombed and this is a replica". Despite that this is worth a visit not only for the fascinating castle, but also for the views.
