# Tokyo

This is an introduction to Tokyo, based on the times I've been there since 2008. I'll kick off with some general tips (most of which apply to all of Japan, but Tokyo's usually the starting point). If you want specific place recommendations, skip ahead.

The disclaimer here is that Tokyo is vast and ever-changing, so these recommendations may date very quickly! Also, as great as some spots are, you'll find your own just by wandering. There's so much to see and do and some of the things that you just stumble across can be the most special.

Most areas have got much more support for English speakers over the years, but some parts can still be a bit overwhelming on your first trip. Everywhere is very friendly though, and a little bit of language goes a long way

Last visited September 2017.

## The basics

### Get a local SIM
Check online with companies like [b-mobile](http://www.bmobile.ne.jp/english/) to buy a local SIM card and get it delivered to the airport post office (there's one at Narita and one at Haneda Domestic, but check opening hours against your flight landing time). It's extremely simple to collect things at the airport, and a SIM will likely save you tons of cash if you're there for any amount of time. Alternatively you can pick them up from airport shops, or from electronics stores like Bic Camera in the city.

The offerings change so rapidly that it's not worth me namechecking too many, but b-mobile have served me well over the last couple of trips with a 5GB/21 day plan, and before that they had an unlimited (but slow after high usage) 14 day option. The first time I went to Japan I used a printed street atlas and failed to find tons of things - Google Maps will make your life so much easier!

### Heading into Tokyo from Narita
The first two times we caught the Airport Limousine Bus, as it went straight to our hotel and let us see some of the countryside on the way. An alternative is the Narita Express train (NEX) which you can catch from directly under the airport, and is what we use now as it's faster and runs more regularly. Both have pros and cons - bear in mind carting large amounts of luggage through enormous, busy, overwhelming stations for lots of changes may not be what you need after a long flight!

### Heading into Tokyo from Haneda
Haneda is much closer to the city, and serves both 'sides' of Tokyo - the Keikyu Line towards Shinagawa (for Shinjuku/Shibuya) and the monorail takes the same amount of time to go towards Hamamatsucho (for Tokyo/Ueno).

### Trains
Japan's trains are run by different networks. If you're thinking about taking any longer distance trains (outside of the airport trip) you may be better off investigating the Japan Rail Pass (a rail pass for overseas visitors). This lets you inclusively travel on selected bullet trains (some types are not included), on the underground network, and other things run by Japan Rail for the duration of your pass. Buy a voucher for the pass in advance, sent to you at home, which you then redeem at JR stations once you get to Japan. You also must get a Temporary Visitor stamp in your passport on arrival.

It's also worth reading up on the different companies, as this will remove some of your confusion. In Tokyo you'll want a Tokyo Metro subway map as well as a JR one! Stations don't connect, so at a station that has both systems you may need to resurface and go back down into the other network.

There are english buttons on the train screens if you need, but the principle is you pay the price shown on the map (top for adult, bottom is child) for a single trip to your destination. (If you're not buying any kind of pass)

### Areas
Generally, most of my favourite areas are over on the West, and that's reflected in these recommendations! Others will have a different preference. I've spent a lot of time in Shibuya and Shinjuku and they feel very homely to me - I can never wait to get back there - however other people find them overwhelmingly touristy and too full-on. If you want to stay over that way but slightly further out, I'd recommend looking at areas like Koenji or Shimokitazawa - both of which are very trendy.

## Places to stay

* Excel Hotel Tokyu, Shibuya - excellent location above the station (and crossing), but had a really bad experience here last time on our honeymoon on a return stay. Won't stay here again because of it.

* Shinjuku Granbell

• Cerulean Tower, Shibuya

* Hotel Century Southern Tower, Shinjuku

## Bars

### Coins Bar, Shibuya
One of my favourite places in the world. Little basement bar that was recently 'done up' for our last visit (but is still quite crap in an endearing way). Everything's cheap (costs *coins*), and we always have a really fun night here. It's one place that I think we've been to on every Japan trip. Gets very busy as it's small, so you may get turned away.

### Spincoaster, Shinjuku
Visited Spincoaster after finding it through reviews, and was extremely impressed. The bar plays a mix of vinyl and digital, and whilst you get a free request with your cover charge we decided not to play anything as the owner/DJ's playlist was so great! Wine and cocktails were both very good, there are rice crackers/chocolate rice snacks on the table (included with the cover charge), and the staff were lovely. Highly recommend if you're in the area and want some good drinks and good music in a chilled out little bar.

### Hitachino Brewing Lab, Akihabara
Has a selection of Hitachino beers on tap as well as small plates of food. The beers swap in and out of rotation daily. By the river, so bring your mosquito repellent! They also have really cool merch.

### Hitachino Brewing Lab, Tokyo
Located at the station, this branch has much less personality (and is smaller) than the Akiba branch. Beers are still excellent.

### Craftheads, Shibuya
Walkable from either Shibuya or Harajuku, this is a great little basement bar with a varied beer selection. You may have to queue to even get in when busy.

### Craft Beer Market, Koenji
Stumbled across this after wandering through the vintage shops in Koenji, and it was a great little watering hole. Done up in the classic 'craft beer pub' style, it's worth a stop if you're in the area.

### Watering Hole, Shinjuku
Great little spot in Shinjuku. Favourites included Boxing Cat brewery.

## Food

With vending machine places, put your money in first, press things to match the food you've probably seen in the window or on a sign, take the tickets and pass them to the chef or whoever comes to the table.

#### Han No Daidokoro (Shibuya)
Yakiniku. Really friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere make this a great experience. The Kobe beef was excellent, but really enjoyed the cucumber and kimchi too.

#### Zuicho (Shibuya)
Tiny, 8 seater restaurant found through a corridor on the ground floor, with no menu other than a question of 'small, medium or large'. Don't let this put you off! The katsudon is well worth worth waiting for, and staff are very friendly. You'll also be given pickles and soup. Only open til 6pm, so time your visit carefully.

#### Tiger Gyoza Hall (Shibuya)
Always seemed to be empty when we passed, which is a shame as some of the dumplings here are great. More expensive than other local places, and is a slightly more generic setting than most (whilst still being nice), which may contribute. Favourites were the coriander gyoza (steamed) and lamb dumplings, but there are extensive food and drink options.

#### Genki Sushi (Shibuya)
Popular kaiten option in Shibuya, which also has a sister shop nearby. Order from a tablet and it'll shoot out from the kitchen to where you are. Possible to change the screen to English if you need. Most things are cheap, and we've had fun drunken times here ordering too much crappy sake (leading to a salmon/fried chicken/carbonara sushi experience which I maintain *did* work!).

#### Kyushu Jangara
A chain, found in places like Harajuku and Akiba amongst others. Favourites are the Bonshan (tonkotsu) and Kobonshan (garlic oil tonkotsu) with the soft boiled egg and menma. Beware, the large beers are LARGE.

#### Numazuko sushi (Shinjuku)
Mid-range sushi with a good selection. Often has a line if you're not there early.

#### Harajuku Gyoza-ro (Harajuku)
Very cheap, but excellent. Basically serve grilled or steamed gyoza and a few sides. Small place and gets very busy, but open 24 hours!

#### Joto curry Shibuya (上等カレー 渋谷本店)
If you want fast food Japanese curry you'll probably head to one of the many, many CoCo Curry shops that you'll find. However if in Shibuya, Joto is a slight step up, and gives a great current (with a few variants and options). Order from the vending machine.

#### Kamukura (Shibuya, elsewhere)
This ramen place was always the straight-off-the-plane stop on early trips to Japan and it's still extremely popular, but on our last visit it seemed really disappointing so we haven't returned in recent years. Maybe it was just because we've had so many more ramens than when we first started visiting, but it felt like it'd definitely lost something that we used to love.

#### Yoshinoya (everywhere)
Not any kind of classy dining, but if you're out and about and wanting a quick, cheap and tasty lunch, you can always dive into a Yoshinoya. A staple fast food option, I usually go for the beef bowl with a raw egg (try it, honestly) and spring onions.

#### Snacks! (everywhere)
If you ever need a really quick snack, jump into a 7-11, Lawson, Family Mart etc. They have all kinds of onigiri and cold boxes in the fridges that you can have heated up for you (or some have microwaves that you can use), or ask for a chashuman (pork bun/bao) or some yakitori skewers at the counter. Snack food is everywhere - if you're going on a train journey grab a bento box at the station (known as ekiben).

#### Shin (Shinjuku)

* Food courts

TODO: add everything else that I keep meaning to!

# Cafes

#### Bar and Cafe WOW (Harajuku)
I was taken to this little cafe rather than finding it, and it turned out to be just the kind of cozy spot that you'd like to escape into on a snowy day. They do a selection of teas including jasmine. [wowcafe.jp](http://wowcafe.jp)

## Other places in the city

### Ghibli museum
I haven't been here since 2008, but the ticket system is still the same - basically it's easiest to **book before you leave your own country!**. The information is all held [here](http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/ticket-information/). When I visited, the museum itself was exactly as charming as you'd imagine, and was a great day out. Getting there was also one of my first ventures outside of the city centre, and walking there through Inokashira Park were great to get an insight into more local life. Don't worry too much about raiding the gift shop as Ghibli merch can be found all over Tokyo/Japan.

### Odaiba
*shudders*. I always seem to have a crap time on Odaiba. It's reasonably expensive to get to, always rains, I always get lost, the food options are crap, and something about the place is just... frustrating as hell. You'll possibly find yourself there for a conference, or because you're a fan of gundam (there's an enormous one outside DiverCity). You may stay for the big (but very dated now) arcade at Palette Town (by the Daikanransha big wheel) where you can ride around on giant pandas. Or the Fuji TV building architecture. There's also a mini Statue of Liberty. A quite interesting Toyota showcase and 'car theme park'. And [Venus Fort](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=venus+fort&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjd0rX2hNzYAhVMyaQKHdJkCI0Q_AUICygC&biw=1344&bih=776) (a shopping centre 'designed for ladies' that resembles an italian city, complete with balconies and sunset sky and fountains)... but good luck ever finding your way out of that place again! In a city that's chock full of authentic culture, Odaiba stands out as an utterly bizzare yet intriguing place. Go if you'd like a taste of fake weirdness and getting trapped in confusing buildings.

### Tsukiji (fish market)
In the course of updating this I've just seen that Tsukiji is moving! It was the world's biggest fish market, and on and off throughout the years you were maybe able to watch the auctions of enormous tuna but were definitely able to wander through endless stalls of incredible sea produce before grabbing breakfast at one of the handful of sushi bars. I would have said that this is one to do if you're jetlagged and awake at a ridiculous time (coming from the UK it's easier to do on one of your first couple of days), but seeing as it's moving you'll have to put that visit on hold.

### Kappabashi
Kappabashi Dōgugai is a long street that houses shops either side of the road that will sell you everything you need to kit out your kitchen business (or your kitchen back home if you're savvy with luggage options). Getting there isn't massively well documented because you can approach it from so many angles, but we tend to head to Tawaramachi station and walk west for 2/3 blocks until you hit the road - then turn right. You can also get to it from Asakusa. The second last time I went, there was a Kappabashi Dōgugai song playing over street speakers that has been stuck in my head ever since. It wasn't playing last time. The web doesn't seen to have it recorded. If you hear it, please record it so that I know it wasn't just in my head.

# Day trips

### Kamakura
If you're only going to Tokyo, a day trip out to Kamakura is highly recommended to see a bit more of the country. There are all kinds of temples, an enormous buddha, a really cute little train, but you'll also probably enjoy just walking through the buildings. The beach isn't a *beach* beach (don't turn up in your bikini), but worth a wander to go and see some fishing boats.
