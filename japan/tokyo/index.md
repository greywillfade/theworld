#Train stamps

###Harajuku
On the left as you approach the station, inside the ticket office. Outside the ticket barriers.

###Yoyogi
JR West Exit, outside the ticket barriers. Not in the ticket office, instead there is a standalone stamp station next to the road.

###Shinjuku
East Exit (not Central), downstairs, inside a ticket office in the right corner as you go in.

###Ikebukuro
Wow this is a bigger station than I thought. This is right by the turnstile entry point (but still outside) at the South Gate, opposite a load of gacha machines. It's NOT in a ticket office.

###Komagome
North Exit, near the ticket machines. Outside of the gates and not in a ticket office.

###Akihabara
Inside the ticket office, near (turn left after) the Electric City exit as you're leaving. Outside of the ticket gates.

###Ochanomizu
Just inside the main entrance, on the left as you're coming in (outside the ticket gates). There is another smaller entrance - not this one.
