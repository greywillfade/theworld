# Bars

#### Spincoaster, Shinjuku
Visited Spincoaster after finding it through reviews, and was extremely impressed. The bar plays a mix of vinyl and digital, and whilst you get a free request with your cover charge we decided not to play anything as the owner/DJ's playlist was so great! Wine and cocktails were both very good, there are rice crackers/chocolate rice snacks on the table (included with the cover charge), and the staff were lovely. Highly recommend if you're in the area and want some good drinks and good music in a chilled out little bar.

#### Hitachino Brewing Lab, Akihabara
Has a selection of Hitachino beers on tap as well as small plates of food. The beers swap in and out of rotation daily. By the river, so bring your mosquito repellent!

# Food
#### Han No Daidokoro (Shibuya)
Yakiniku. Really friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere make this a great experience. The Kobe beef was excellent, but really enjoyed the cucumber and kimchi too.

#### Zuicho (Shibuya)
Tiny, 8 seater restaurant found through a corridor on the ground floor, with no menu other than a question of 'small, medium or large'. Don't let this put you off! The katsudon is well worth worth waiting for, and staff are very friendly. You'll also be given pickles and soup. Only open til 6pm, so time your visit carefully.

#### Tiger Gyoza Hall (Shibuya)
Always seemed to be empty when we passed, which is a shame as some of the dumplings here are great. More expensive than other local places, and is a slightly more generic setting than most (whilst still being nice), which may contribute. Favourites were the coriander gyoza (steamed) and lamb dumplings, but there are extensive food and drink options.

#### Genki Sushi (Shibuya)
Popular kaiten option in Shibuya, which also has a sister shop nearby. Order from a tablet and it'll shoot out from the kitchen to where you are. Possible to change the screen to English if you need. Most things are cheap, and we've had fun drunken times here ordering too much crappy sake.

#### Kyushu Jangara
A chain, found in places like Harajuku and Akiba. Have the Karabon ramen. Beware, the large beers are LARGE.

#### Numazuko sushi (Shinjuku)
Mid-range sushi with a good selection. Often has a line if you're not there early.

#### Harajuku Gyoza-ro (Harajuku)
Very cheap, but excellent. Basically serve grilled or steamed gyoza and a few sides. Small place and gets very busy.

#### Joto curry Shibuya (上等カレー 渋谷本店)
If you want fast food Japanese curry you'll probably head to one of the many, many CoCo Curry shops that you'll find. However if in Shibuya, Joto is a slight step up, and gives a great current (with a few variants and options). Order from the vending machine.

#### Kamukura (Shibuya, elsewhere)
This ramen place was always the straight-off-the-plane stop and it's extremely popular, but on my last visit it seemed really disappointing. Maybe it was just because we've had so many more ramens than when we first started visiting, but it felt like it'd definitely lost something that we used to love.

#### Yoshinoya (everywhere)
Not any kind of classy dining, but if you're out and about and wanting a quick, cheap and tasty lunch, you can always dive into a Yoshinoya. A staple fast food option, I usually go for the beef bowl with a raw egg (try it, honestly) and spring onions.

# Train stamps

### Harajuku
On the left as you approach the station, inside the ticket office. Outside the ticket barriers.

### Yoyogi
JR West Exit, outside the ticket barriers. Not in the ticket office, instead there is a standalone stamp station next to the road.

### Shinjuku
East Exit (not Central), downstairs, inside a ticket office in the right corner as you go in.

### Ikebukuro
Wow this is a bigger station than I thought. This is right by the turnstile entry point (but still outside) at the South Gate, opposite a load of gacha machines. It's NOT in a ticket office.

### Komagome
North Exit, near the ticket machines. Outside of the gates and not in a ticket office.

### Akihabara
Inside the ticket office, near (turn left after) the Electric City exit as you're leaving. Outside of the ticket gates.

### Ochanomizu
Just inside the main entrance, on the left as you're coming in (outside the ticket gates). There is another smaller entrance - not this one.

### Shinagawa
In the middle of the main seat reservation office, against the window as you look out towards the central entrance gates.
