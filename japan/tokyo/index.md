# Tokyo

Last visited Summer 2018.

## The basics

### Heading into Tokyo from Narita
The first two times we caught the Airport Limousine Bus, as it went straight to our hotel and let us see some of the countryside on the way. An alternative is the Narita Express train (NEX) which you can catch from directly under the airport, and is what we use now as it's faster and runs more regularly. Both have pros and cons - bear in mind carting large amounts of luggage through enormous, busy, overwhelming stations for lots of changes may not be what you need after a long flight!

### Heading into Tokyo from Haneda
Haneda is much closer to the city, and serves both 'sides' of Tokyo - the Keikyu Line towards Shinagawa (for Shinjuku/Shibuya) and the monorail takes the same amount of time to go towards Hamamatsucho (for Tokyo/Ueno).


## Where to stay

### Areas
Ask different people, and you'll get different answers to this. Generally, most of my favourite areas are over on the West, and that's reflected in these recommendations. Others will have a different preference.

I've spent a lot of time in Shibuya, Shinjuku, Yoyogi and they feel very homely to me - I can never wait to get back there - however other people find them overwhelmingly touristy and too full-on. If you want to stay over that way but slightly further out, I'd recommend looking at areas like Koenji or Shimokitazawa - both of which have had huge booms in popularity over recent years but are still seen as a bit more trendy and hipster. This year I also stayed more centrally, in Iidabashi, which was initially for the convenience of a daily commute but I actually found it to be a pretty great hub for getting around. I'm personally less keen on the Western side, mainly because I tend to spend lots of time over in the East. I also find many of the hotel locations in areas like Tokyo Station a bit more dull (although there are of course exceptions).

Below I've included some specific places I've stayed over the years, from pricey to more affordable:

#### Palace Hotel Tokyo
We stayed here with free reward nights, and it's a splurge hotel. The rooms are beautiful and there are some lovely touches for things they provide. As the name suggests, it's right on the side of the Imperial Palace which is a lovely view (we had a balcony and loved standing outside even though it was winter!) and is very close to Tokyo station. However it's not my favourite part of the city, so whilst it's nice for a short stay I wouldn't want to base myself here. 

#### Excel Hotel Tokyu, Shibuya
We've stayed here a couple of times. Pretty standard business hotel that has an excellent location above the station (and crossing), but we had a disappointingly (and uncharacteristic in Japan) poor experience here on our honeymoon. Won't stay here again because of it, but as a hotel it's a decent enough place to stay if you want the views (if a bit overpriced).

#### Cerulean Tower, Shibuya
The first place we ever stayed in Tokyo, and somewhere we happily revisited a couple of years later. It's close to Shibuya station and rooms have fantastic views, but... at the time of writing I don't think it's been updated in about 10 years. It's again a pretty standard business hotel, nice but not hugely memorable, and still charges a pretty steep price. 

#### Hotel Century Southern Tower, Shinjuku
Another place to stay for the views, this is yet another businessy hotel with perfectly adequate rooms and a pretty great location (just south of the enormous JR Shinjuku station). Again it's becoming a bit dated and isn't a 'special' hotel, but a safe enough bet.

#### Shinjuku Granbell
Mid-range is the Granbell, of which there are a few in Tokyo. We stayed in the Shinjuku one, which is a little bit of a walk from Shinjuku main JR station. We'd booked a pretty standard room as we were only there for a couple of nights, but were upgraded to the [luxury designer double](http://www.granbellhotel.jp/en/shinjuku/room/m_double/) which was a really lovely room. Note that some of the other rooms are pretty small - there'll be a theme with some of the other hotels after this!

#### Remm Akihabara
We stayed here for just under a week in January 2018. Just outside one of the Akiba station exits, we chose this to be near some friends who were staying around the corner in an Airbnb. The rooms were clean, very functional, and mid-range in price, however be mindful that this was another small one for two people. Excellent blackout blinds though, and no noise whatsoever from the station below.

#### APA hotels
APA Hotels are a widespread budget hotel chain in Japan. I've stayed in the Shinjuku Gyoenmae (okay) and Iidabashi (good) ones on my own and an individual room was perfectly adequate, but be warned that rooms are again tiny if you've got a couple of people staying. However, the price, and the fact that they often include washing machines/onsens and other services make them a cheap and functional option if you're just wanting a reliable place to crash.

#### Belken Hotel
Over Tokyo Station way, the Belken is another modern, budget/small room option that's again perfectly decent for solo travellers or people who want something basic. I again stayed here alone, and to be honest preferred APAs, but would have no problem staying here again for a budget option.

#### Airbnb
This year Japan changed some legislation which caused a huge shakeup of the Airbnb properties. We stayed in a lovely one near Yoyogi but it's no longer currently available and I suspect that played a part. However, in general you can find some _brilliant_ options available in Japan. If you're after staying somewhere a bit more local, or don't need the trappings of a hotel then definitely give Airbnb a look.


## Bars

### Coins Bar, Shibuya
One of my favourite places in the world. Little basement bar that was recently 'done up' for our last visit (but is still quite crap in an endearing way). Everything's cheap (costs *coins*), and we always have a really fun night here. It's one place that I think we've been to on every Japan trip. Gets very busy as it's small, so you may get turned away.

### Craftheads, Shibuya
Walkable from either Shibuya or Harajuku, this is a great little basement bar with a varied beer selection. You may have to queue to even get in when busy.

### Omohara Beer Forest
Located on top of the Tokyu Plaza building at a main crossing in Harajuku, this is a lovely little oasis to visit in the heat of summer (but seems to run all year round). A little shack from the Yona Yona beer company serves a selection of their (great) beers as well as some limited snacks.

### Spincoaster, Shinjuku
Visited Spincoaster after finding it through reviews, and was extremely impressed. The bar plays a mix of vinyl and digital, and whilst you get a free request with your cover charge we decided not to play anything as the owner/DJ's playlist was so great! Wine and cocktails were both very good, there are rice crackers/chocolate rice snacks on the table (included with the cover charge), and the staff were lovely. Highly recommend if you're in the area and want some good drinks and good music in a chilled out little bar.

### Watering Hole, Shinjuku
Great little spot in Shinjuku. Favourites included Boxing Cat brewery. Not too many tables, but really friendly atmosphere. Some bar snacks/small plates served.

### 8bit cafe, Shinjuku
One of those slightly intimidating, commit or bust, 5th floor bars. As you'd expect from the name, it's full of gaming merch and old games to play. There's even a Power Glove!

### Park Hyatt New York Bar, Shinjuku
The place everyone goes to pretend they're Bill Murray/Scarlett Johansson in Lost In Translation. Comes with a cover charge for non-hotel guests, drinks are what you'd expect from a pricey hotel bar, but cool views, a chilled out classy atmosphere, and obvious film nerd kudos.

### Hitachino Brewing Lab, Akihabara
Has a selection of Hitachino beers on tap as well as small plates of food. The beers swap in and out of rotation daily. By the river, so bring your mosquito repellent! They also have really cool merch.

### Hitachino Brewing Lab, Tokyo
Located at the station, this branch has much less personality (and is smaller) than the Akiba branch. Beers are still excellent.

### Craft Beer Market, Koenji
Stumbled across this after wandering through the vintage shops in Koenji, and it was a great little watering hole. Done up in the classic 'craft beer pub' style, it's worth a stop if you're in the area.

### acca, Koenji
I saw this on one trip, but went in alone on the next. It was shortly after opening and I was the only person in there, which was a nice opportunity to practice my Japanese with the just-right-amount-of-chatty barman. No idea if English is spoken - the menus I saw were Japanese only but actually asked for recommendations.

### Bar High Five, Ginza
One of those bars that pops up on all of the 'top' lists. Small basement bar with impeccable service from staff with excellent English. No menus, instead you explain the kind of thing that you like and they make you something (and that something will be delicious). Classy atmosphere, no photos allowed unless you ask. Cover charge for little snacks.

### Star Bar, Ginza
Not far from Bar High Five, this bar has a similar feel but works from a menu. My drink companion and I got 'promoted' up to a bar from a table, which is clearly the place to be. Excellent selection of cocktails, and a good vibe. From what I remember smoking was allowed, so perhaps something to consider if this bothers you.

## Food
A few places that I felt prompted to make notes about, but by no means definitive. Explore and find your own!

#### Tsujihan (つじ半) (Tokyo - Kaisendon)
Prepare to queue for this amazing Kaisendon (海鮮丼) as it's very, very popular. The restaurant seats around 12 people, all counter-style around the open kitchen. The menu, from memory, has I think 3 options - essentially different levels of luxurious seafood mix piled on top of your rice. Prices are extremely reasonable, around 1000JPY for the base level. After finishing you're able to call out for some more rice, which is presented back to you in your bowl with delicious seafood stock. Definitely worth a visit. Limited to no English observed when I was there.

#### Hashidaya (Shibuya - chicken)
I still dream about the 'tori ikura' (yolk) I had here. This is a chicken place. They do chicken sashimi, oyakodon and more. It's amazing. It also has no English menu and they don't speak English so not one for the fainthearted but it's SO GOOD.

#### Han No Daidokoro (Shibuya - yakiniku)
Really friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere make this a great experience. The Kobe beef was excellent, but really enjoyed the cucumber and kimchi too.

#### Zuicho (Shibuya - katsudon)
Tiny, 8 seater restaurant found through a corridor on the ground floor, with no menu other than a question of 'small, medium or large'. Don't let this put you off! The katsudon is well worth worth waiting for, and staff are very friendly. You'll also be given pickles and soup. Only open til 6pm, so time your visit carefully.

#### Tiger Gyoza Hall (Shibuya - gyoza)
Always seemed to be empty when we passed, which is a shame as some of the dumplings here are great. More expensive than other local places, and is a slightly more generic setting than most (whilst still being nice), which may contribute. Favourites were the coriander gyoza (steamed) and lamb dumplings, but there are extensive food and drink options.

#### Genki Sushi (Shibuya - kaiten sushi)
This is a touristy one. Popular kaiten option in Shibuya, which also has a sister shop nearby. Order from a tablet and it'll shoot out from the kitchen to where you are. Possible to change the screen to English if you need. Most things are cheap, and we've had fun drunken times here ordering too much crappy sake (leading to a salmon/fried chicken/carbonara sushi experience which I maintain *did* work!).

#### Udon Yamacho うどん 山長 (Ebisu - udon)
Slightly tucked away, this is a friendly place that serves delicious udon. Try the curry beef.

#### Tonkatsu Tonki (Meguro - tonkatsu)
A famous restaurant that serves one thing - tonkatsu. You can order rōsu (fatty pork) or hire (lean), but that's it. If you come at a busy time be prepared to wait. All seats are at a counter around the kitchen, which means you get great views of the process. The person who cuts scorching meat with his bare hands is particularly impressive!

#### Roast Beef Ohno (Akihabara - donburi)
Raw wagyu donburi which looks bizarre in photos but it utterly delicious. Tiny place, I came alone and late so didn't have a problem but other times queues are long.

#### Butayaro (Akiba/Ochanomizu - donburi)
BBQ meat donburi. Vending machine ordering. Delicious, and excellent for a hangover...

#### Kyushu Jangara (Akihabara, Harajuku... - ramen)
A chain, found in places like Harajuku and Akiba amongst others. Favourites are the Bonshan (tonkotsu) and Kobonshan (garlic oil tonkotsu) with the soft boiled egg and menma. Beware, the large beers are LARGE.

#### Butayaro (Kanda - donburi)
Classic small place, one dish, different sizes. This is just bbq pork donburi in an unrefined spot up some stairs, but excellent eats.

#### Shin (Shinjuku - udon)
Quite possibly my favourite udon ever. Get the warm egg, black pepper and butter one, with extra beef. Tiny place, just a few counter seats and a couple of tables, and gets incredibly busy. We went once in a blizzard and still had a tiny wait, but at more 'normal' times we've had to wait 30mins-1hr stood on the street. Worth it.

#### 餃子の福包 新宿店 (gyoza)
We tried going here once but it was shut, so I was very happy to come across it again completely by chance when I stayed opposite on another trip. At times lines get long, but if you can find a quiet time this is a great lunch option.

#### Numazuko sushi (Shinjuku)
Mid-range sushi with a good selection. Often has a line if you're not there early.

#### Harajuku Gyoza-ro (Harajuku)
Very cheap, but excellent. Basically serve grilled or steamed gyoza and a few sides. Small place and gets very busy, but open 24 hours!

#### Sakura Tei (Harajuku - okonomiyaki)
Another pretty touristy one, but very fun. A cook your own okonomiyaki place. Order all kinds of toppings, and you'll get to hot plate them into a delicious meal by yourself. Bring friends for a fun social dining experience.

#### Joto curry Shibuya (上等カレー 渋谷本店)
If you want fast food Japanese curry you'll probably head to one of the many, many CoCo Curry shops that you'll find. However if in Shibuya, Joto is a slight step up, and gives a great current (with a few variants and options). Order from the vending machine.

#### Kamukura (Shibuya, elsewhere)
This ramen place was always the straight-off-the-plane stop on early trips to Japan and it's still extremely popular, but on our last visit it seemed really disappointing so we haven't returned in recent years. Maybe it was just because we've had so many more ramens than when we first started visiting, but it felt like it'd definitely lost something that we used to love.

#### Yoshinoya (everywhere)
Not any kind of classy dining, but if you're out and about and wanting a quick, cheap and tasty lunch, you can always dive into a Yoshinoya. A staple fast food option, I usually go for the beef bowl with a raw egg (try it, honestly) and spring onions.

#### Snacks! (everywhere)
If you ever need a really quick snack, jump into a 7-11, Lawson, Family Mart etc. They have all kinds of onigiri and cold boxes in the fridges that you can have heated up for you (or some have microwaves that you can use), or ask for a chashuman (pork bun/bao) or some yakitori skewers at the counter. Snack food is everywhere - if you're going on a train journey grab a bento box at the station (known as ekiben).

#### Food courts
Tokyu Foodshow Shibuya, Isetan Shinjuku etc have extensive food courts in the basement. There are grocery sections but also tons of 'fast food' (karaage, siu mai, gyoza, yakitori... etc). Try to find one of the designated standing eating spots (they are there!) to avoid being the awful gaijin eating on the street outside.

TODO: add everything else that I keep meaning to!


# Cafes

#### Bar and Cafe WOW (Harajuku)
I was taken to this little cafe rather than finding it, and it turned out to be just the kind of cozy spot that you'd like to escape into on a snowy day. They do a selection of teas including jasmine. [wowcafe.jp](http://wowcafe.jp)

#### Shiro-Hige's Cream Puff Factory
Beautiful, delicious, Totoro cream buns found in an extremely kawaii side street shop. Very instagram-tastic, but also very tasty.

#### Nana's green tea

#### ON THE WAY, coffee & cupcake

## Other places in the city

### Ghibli museum
I haven't been here since 2008, but the ticket system is still the same - basically it's easiest to **book before you leave your own country!**. The information is all held [here](http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/ticket-information/). When I visited, the museum itself was exactly as charming as you'd imagine, and was a great day out. Getting there was also one of my first ventures outside of the city centre, and walking there through Inokashira Park were great to get an insight into more local life. Don't worry too much about raiding the gift shop as Ghibli merch can be found all over Tokyo/Japan.

### Odaiba
*shudders*. I always seem to have a crap time on Odaiba. It's reasonably expensive to get to (not much, just in the scheme of other trips), always rains, I always get lost, the food options are crap, and something about the place is just... frustrating as hell. You'll possibly find yourself there for a conference, or because you're a fan of gundam (there's an enormous one outside DiverCity). You may stay for the big (but very dated now) arcade at Palette Town (by the Daikanransha big wheel) where you can ride around on giant pandas. Or the Fuji TV building architecture. There's also a mini Statue of Liberty. A quite interesting Toyota showcase and 'car theme park'. And [Venus Fort](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=venus+fort&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjd0rX2hNzYAhVMyaQKHdJkCI0Q_AUICygC&biw=1344&bih=776) (a shopping centre 'designed for ladies' that resembles an italian city, complete with balconies and sunset sky and fountains)... but good luck ever finding your way out of that place again! In a city that's chock full of authentic culture, Odaiba stands out as an utterly bizzare yet intriguing place. Go if you'd like a taste of fake weirdness and getting trapped in confusing buildings.

As an amendment to this I went to Odaiba for the 海の日 festival on the beach where thousands of lanterns were lit. It was _lovely_ and I had a wonderful, relaxed time for the first time ever. Perhaps there is hope!

### Tsukiji (fish market)
I haven't been to the market since it moved locations. It was the world's biggest fish market, and on and off throughout the years you were maybe able to watch the auctions of enormous tuna but were definitely able to wander through endless stalls of incredible sea produce before grabbing breakfast at one of the handful of sushi bars. One to do if you're jetlagged and awake at a ridiculous time (coming from the UK it's easier to do on one of your first couple of days), but can't vouch for what it's like now.

### Kappabashi
Kappabashi Dōgugai is a long street that houses shops either side of the road that will sell you everything you need to kit out your kitchen business (or your kitchen back home if you're savvy with luggage options). Getting there isn't massively well documented because you can approach it from so many angles, but we tend to head to Tawaramachi station and walk west for 2/3 blocks until you hit the road - then turn right. You can also get to it from Asakusa. The second last time I went, there was a Kappabashi Dōgugai song playing over street speakers that has been stuck in my head ever since. It wasn't playing last time. The web doesn't seen to have it recorded. If you hear it, please record it so that I know it wasn't just in my head.

# Day trips

### Enoshima

### Yokohama

### Kamakura
If you're only going to Tokyo, a day trip out to Kamakura is highly recommended to see a bit more of the country. There are all kinds of temples, an enormous buddha, a really cute little train, but you'll also probably enjoy just walking through the buildings. The beach isn't a *beach* beach (don't turn up in your bikini), but worth a wander to go and see some fishing boats.

# Train stamps

### Harajuku
On the left as you approach the station, inside the ticket office. Outside the ticket barriers.

### Shinjuku
East Exit (not Central), downstairs, inside a ticket office in the right corner as you go in.

### Ikebukuro
Wow this is a bigger station than I thought. This is right by the turnstile entry point (but still outside) at the South Gate, opposite a load of gacha machines. It's NOT in a ticket office.

### Komagome
