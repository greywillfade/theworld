# Hong Kong

Advice all from [Charis Rooda](http://twitter.com/charis) at present! To be updated with my findings after September.

## Practical advice
"When you arrive, take the airport express to town, from there take a taxi to the hotel."

"There are some ATM’s at the airport."

"In general, taxis are good and cheap. And when you’re tired from a full day, take a taxi"

"Get a local taxi app."

"Get a local SIM card - all local shops sell them and they are a few euros a day"

"Hong Kong is hot. Very hot! It has been raining quite a lot, and I hope that’s coming to an end. Still, it’s is very humid. 70% to 90% which means if you walk outside you get sweaty. So pack you shortest dresses and skirts. Which is fine anyway, because anything goes here."

"I mentioned a lot of places are on HK island, but with the Metro you get there so fast. Get an octopus card (like Oyster) and you can easily check in."

## Hotels
Hotel ICON & rooftop bar

## Bars
Rooftop bar - Eye bar - Kowloon side.
Rooftop bar - Sevva - HK island side.

## Food 
"Besides the lovely Chinese food, HK also has quite a lot of Western food. There is cheap food and there is expensive food. Since rent is so high and people dig luxury things, it doesn’t always mean that expensive food is really good.

Personally I am not a big fan of the very local food. Because the meat has a lot of bones and Hong Kong people like their food blend and gooey."

[Open Rice](http://openrice.com) is the restaurant website in HK.

I really like [Yu causeway bay](https://www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/r-yu-causeway-bay-sichuan-noodles-rice-noodles-r39073) on Hong Kong Island. It’s a small Sichuan restaurant and their food is not too spicy.

[Little Bao](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g294217-d6420711-Reviews-Little_Bao-Hong_Kong.html) is a cool little place with Chinese baos. Bit fusion. And they do cocktails too.

Hong Kong has many good Indians. [Bombay dreams](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g294217-d799250-Reviews-Bombay_Dreams-Hong_Kong.html) is one of them

[Woodlands](https://www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/r-woodlands-international-restaurant-tsim-sha-tsui-indian-vegetarian-r21500) is South Indian veggie and has a more Indian feel ;-) 

There are a few [Din Tai Fung](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g294217-d5400408-Reviews-Din_Tai_Fung_Silvercord-Hong_Kong.html) branches in town. Perfect for Shanghai food. Make sure you order the ’xiao long bao’. The soupy pork dumplings. They have a Michelin star and are more like a posh canteen.

In general this [Trip Advisor list](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurants-g294217-Hong_Kong.html#EATERY_OVERVIEW_BOX) is pretty good.

## Things to do

"I think the [trip advisor list](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attractions-g294217-Activities-Hong_Kong.html#ATTRACTION_SORT_WRAPPER) is pretty accurate"

"Peak! Take the peak tram, on Google you can see how busy it is. Sometimes the lines are 1.5 hour. So make sure you check first. If the line is too long, bus 15 goes to the peak (quite a ride :)). Or take a taxi."

"Star Ferry to Hk Island. And from there go for a walk either way. Very nice for evenings too."

"The whole TST, Jordan area is great for walking around, so much to see. And a market every night."

"The [Big Buddha](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g294217-d537975-Reviews-Tian_Tan_Buddha_Big_Buddha-Hong_Kong.html) is nice, esp. when you’re tired of the city."

"Oh and I don’t know if the cable car is working already, might have to check that. Otherwise you need to take a bus, also fine, but might be considering the travel."

"Sheung Wan on Hk island is also lovely for walking around, so many murals, shops. Hipster alert!"

"I did a walking tour in Sheung Wan with the Webconf speakers with [this lady](http://samthelocal.com/locals/winnien/), she is lovely. Can recommend that too."

"If you are tired of the city and want to go hiking. These are the [most beautiful beaches in HK](http://hikehongkong.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/sai-kung-tai-lon-sai-wan.html). Hiking to the beaches will be hot, but you will survive if you bring enough water. And take the boat back, it’s a very cool ride!"

"[This hike](http://hikehongkong.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/dragons-back-option-2-mtr-and-walk-to.html) is also very cool"

"And if you’re here on a Wednesday, though they might have summer stop, make sure you check online, go to the [horse racing](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g294217-d320717-Reviews-Happy_Valley_Racecourse-Hong_Kong.html)"

"The islands Lamma and Cheung Chau are both very nice too."
