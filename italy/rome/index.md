## Sightseeing

Go to the Pantheon, the Roman Forum, Palatine Hill, Circus Maximus, Colosseum, Trajan's Market, Piazza Venezia.

Walk up the hill here to peer through the keyhole over at the Vatican. https://goo.gl/maps/bFzvko87P982

We went in September, and the Trevi Fountain was absolutely packed whatever time of day and night. Go and have a look, but personally it wasn't quite the serene sight I was expecting!

The Spanish Steps likewise I also didn't find that appealing, but go if you're around that area.

You can only get to some parts of the Colosseum with tours, and for other things tours help you skip ridiculous queues. Highly, highly recommend this company for enjoyable, fascinating, friendly walking tours: https://www.walksofitaly.com/

If it's nice weather you can do a bike ride down Appia Antica. Hire bikes here: https://goo.gl/maps/tQ7mp2kJBm42 The first bit is up quite a hill, and the cobbles are _really_ bad for a while at the start but push through as it's great the further you go.

## Eating and drinking

My favourite spots were in Trastevere, south of the river.

We went for a low key snacky dinner here followed by street drinks around the corner and had a fun night but would also be good for lunch: https://www.trapizzino.it/trapizzino/trapizzino-roma-trastevere/

Another good meal had here: https://foursquare.com/v/ristorante-antico-carlone/4bd9bfcc2e6f0f47cecc0b08 (we were lucky to get a table outside - better to pre-book)

## Where to stay

We stayed in the [Dharma](https://www.dharmagroup.it/hotel/dharma-luxury) which was perfectly fine but not sure we'd go back. For starters the location wasn't great - as we were using trains a lot we decided to stay around the station, but I wouldn't recommend the area either in terms of proximity to restaurants/sights, or the fact that it just didn't feel great once you left the main road. It also is a hotel that's taken over a couple of floors of an old apartment or office building, and just feels a bit disjointed. Breakfast isn't great, and is served next door in a neighbouring restaurant.
